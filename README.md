# Abstract
This analysis was carried out with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) data [1]. The data is formed by 46 csv files, each csv data file contains approximately 500 thousand rows of data, and files are numbered chronologically with the earliest trade records in the files with the lower numbers. We needed to merge all files into a single dataset, the new data set has 22,618,717 rows and 21 columns. The data has been recorded from 1975 to 2021.
